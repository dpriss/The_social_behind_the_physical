# Introduction 
This repository contains the data and scripts used for the analysis presented in the paper Pri√ü, D., Prell, C., Lawrence, D., Wainwright, J., Turnbull, L. "The social behind the physical - Assessing tie formation processes of ancient route systems", published in the Journal of Archaeological Science. 

# Content
The repository contains one folder with Data, one with Plots and one with Scripts. 
  
  * Plots: Plots of network graphs and gof grpahs created in the script "3. MTERGM_hybrid.R"
  
  * Data & Scripts:
    + Input data for the scripts
    + 1.DNA.R - Script for a descriptive network analysis of the networks. This scirpt is meant to help the reader get accustomed with the data.
    + 2.ERGM_periods_hybrid.R - Script to implement ERGMs for the individual time periods (waves) analysed in the paper.
    + 3.MTERGM_hybrid.R - Script to implement the MTERGM.

# How to use 

We advise to work throught the script 1.DNA.R first as it provides the code for an exploratory analysis. We first import the data files which can found in the Data & Scripts folder before creating some plots of the networks with different metrics such as degree and site size to compare and visuslise them. The basic plots of the networks are presented in Figure 3 while the other plots just serve as a means of orientation. We then proceed by calculating selected network metrics. Those metrics are not mentioned in the paper but instead should just help the reader to understand the networks.  

The other two scripts can be run in any order, depending on the reader's preferences. The script 2.ERGM_periods_hybrid.R contains the code for the ERGMs for the cross-sectional networks, i.e. for the six periods. Every network is analysed independently. We present the results of the models and the gof plots in the SI of the paper (Table 1 and Figure 5 - 10) because those models are just additional information for the interested reader and are not explained in detail in the paper itself. They were added on a reviewer's request and we think that they supplement the paper very well.

Script 3.MTERGM_hybrid.R contains the main analysis presented in the paper, i.e. the MTERMG. We first provide the simple models with and without temporal dependencies, i.e. the models that just include the hypotheses mentioned in the paper. We then present the fitted models, i.e. the models that include additonal ERGM terms that improve the gof. The results of the fitted models are given in Table 3 while the gof plots are shown in the SI, Figure 1 - 4. 

There are two options to run the scrirpts, either dowload them and run them locally or use the provided Dockerfile. Please note that to use the Dockerfile, you will need to set the working directory before building the project (i.e. by typing `cd /path` into the terminal before following the instructions in the Dockerfile). If you run the scripts in your local RStudio. please use `setwd` at the begining of the script to change to the folder that the scripts are in to work properly. We commented this line out because it interfered with the Dockerfile environment.
